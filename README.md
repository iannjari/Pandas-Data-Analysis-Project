# Pandas-Data-Analysis-Project
A repo of my first Exploratory Data Analysis Task using Pandas Library.

## Background Information 
The project was inspired by a youtube <a href="https://youtu.be/eMOA1pPVUc4" target="_blank"> video </a> from Keith Galli.

The folder contains a Jupyter notebook, an input and output folder.
The input folder contains sales .CSV files for each month of 2019.
The output folder contains 2 CSV files resulting from the workbook.

## The process

### Cleaning the data by:

>Dropping NaN values from DataFrame
Removing rows based on conditions
Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

### Data exploration by solving questions such as:

What month did most sales take place?
What city sold the most product?
What time should we increase staff to handle increased demand?

### Pandas & matplotlib methods used:
Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
Adding columns
Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
Using the .apply() method
Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
Labeling our graphs
